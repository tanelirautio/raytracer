# Raytracer
The Ray Tracer Challenge

Implementation of the ray tracer presented in the book [The Ray Tracer Challenge](http://raytracerchallenge.com/).

Emphasis is to follow the book very closely. This means that the ray tracer is very slow and bare bones. When I'm fully finished with the book I might come back to optimize the code. 

Only addition I have done is to use SDL for showing the rendered image in a window. The implementation presented in the book just saves the image to disk after rendering.

At the moment this is targeted only to Windows and Visual Studio 2022.

This is still very much work in progress. Currently the ray tracer contains everything described in the book up to chapter 10.
